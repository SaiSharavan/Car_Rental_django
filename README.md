# Car Rental Application

This is a web-based car rental application designed and developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, and a database system SQLite.

In developing the web-based car rental application, Python played a pivotal role, particularly through the Django framework. I leveraged my Python skills to build the server-side logic that powers the entire application. Django, a high-level Python web framework, allowed me to efficiently manage the backend operations, including user authentication, data management, and interaction with the database.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.
- **Car Listings**: View available cars for rental with details such as make, model, year, and rental price.
- **Booking System**: Users can book a car for a specific duration.
- **Admin Panel**: Admin users can add, edit, or delete car listings and manage user bookings.
- **Search and Filter**: Users can search for cars based on criteria like make, model, or price range.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Django(Python)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
